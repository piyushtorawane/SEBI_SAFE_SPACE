3. **Mismatch Detector**: Contradiction identification
4. **Risk Scorer**: Multi-factor assessment

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with requests for API integration

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Streamlit
- Required packages (see requirements.txt)

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install streamlit requests

# Run the application
streamlit run announcement_analyzer.py --server.port 8503
```

### Alternative Installation
```bash
# Install all project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the analyzer
streamlit run announcement_analyzer.py
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. **Dashboard Overview**
- **Summary Metrics**: Total announcements, credibility distribution
- **Real-time Feed**: Latest corporate announcements
- **Filter Controls**: Company and credibility level filters

### 2. **Fetching Announcements**
- Click "üîÑ Fetch Latest Announcements" to get fresh data
- System automatically loads initial data on startup
- Handles API failures gracefully with fallback data

### 3. **Understanding Credibility Levels**

#### üü¢ **High Credibility (Score: 0.7-1.0)**
- Consistent with historical patterns
- Moderate, realistic claims
- No contradictions detected
- **Example**: "Quarterly dividend declaration approved by board"

#### üü° **Medium Credibility (Score: 0.4-0.69)**
- Some concerns or limited historical data
- Mixed signals in announcement
- Requires additional verification
- **Example**: "Steady growth reported amid market challenges"

#### üî¥ **Low Credibility (Score: 0.0-0.39)**
- Contradicts recent financial filings
- Extreme or unrealistic claims
- Suspicious pattern detected
- **Example**: "Record profit after 3 consecutive quarterly losses"

### 4. **Red Flag Detection**
The system automatically flags suspicious patterns:
- **Profit Claims**: Record profits after recent losses
- **Loss Claims**: Massive losses after positive trends
- **Extreme Language**: Excessive superlatives and guarantees
- **Pattern Breaks**: Sudden reversals in financial narrative

## Sample Analysis Cases

### Case 1: High Risk Detection
**Input**: "Reliance Industries reports record profit of ‚Çπ15,000 crores with exceptional growth"
**Historical Context**: Recent quarterly losses and negative sentiment
**Result**: üî¥ Low Credibility - "Claims record profit despite 3 recent negative reports"

### Case 2: Consistent Pattern
**Input**: "HDFC Bank board meeting scheduled for dividend declaration"
**Historical Context**: Regular corporate governance announcements
**Result**: üü¢ High Credibility - "Announcement appears consistent with historical pattern"

### Case 3: Mixed Signals
**Input**: "TCS announces moderate growth with cautious outlook"
**Historical Context**: Varied recent performance
**Result**: üü° Medium Credibility - "Mixed signals require additional verification"

## API Integration

### Mock BSE API (Current Implementation)
```python
# Endpoint simulation
MOCK_BSE_API_URL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

# Company mapping
BSE_COMPANIES = [
    "Reliance Industries", "TCS", "HDFC Bank", 
    "Infosys", "ICICI Bank", "Hindustan Unilever"
]
```

### Real BSE API Integration (Future)
```python
# Real implementation would use
BSE_API_ENDPOINT = "https://api.bseindia.com/v1/corporate-announcements"
REQUIRED_HEADERS = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

## Historical Data Structure

### CSV Format
```csv
Company,Date,AnnouncementText,Sentiment
Reliance Industries,2024-02-15,Reliance reports quarterly loss...,negative
TCS,2024-02-18,TCS announces steady growth...,positive
HDFC Bank,2024-02-21,HDFC board meeting scheduled...,neutral
```

### Analysis Fields
